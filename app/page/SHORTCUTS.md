# Keyboard shortcuts

`CmdOrCtrl` is the `command` key on Apple keyboards or the `ctrl` key on PC keyboards.

## Tabs and window

`h` / `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+]` : tabs left
`l` / `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+[`: tabs right
`x` / `CmdOrCtrl+w` : close tab
`CmdOrCtrl+Shift+w` will close the current window

## Message feeds

`j` : next message (down)
`k` : previous message
`o` : open message thread (and scroll to position of this message in that thread)
` ` ` : toggle raw message view for currently selected message (` ` ` = backtick, lives on the same key as `~`)

composing : cttrl + enter = post

## Nav bar thing

`@` : start a person query
`#` : start a channel query
`?` : start a search query
`/` : start a navigation  (e.g. /public)  - need to re-instate suggestions for this

you can also paste a message id (starts with `%`) in here to navigate to it. Same with blobs (`&`)
